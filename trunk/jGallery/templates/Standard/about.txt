This is a plain skin with original JAlbum look.
Use this skin as a base for your own skins by copying this directory and renaming it to something smart.
Take care to study how I make use of the template language of JAlbum in the template files
index.htt and slide.htt and how I've made several color and font variations to this skin
by the use of style sheets.

Special feature: Uses dynamic html to pop up camera information on slide pages when requested.
